        <p>My passion for education extends outside of the classroom and personal benefit as I enjoy sharing the 
          benefits of education as an LA Tech ambassador, where I have the honor to provide tours to prospective 
          students and their families. It is here that I reinforce these educational benefits from my personal 
          experiences and promote the rewards that come with continuous and higher-level learning, not only specific 
          to LA Tech but education in general. In the picture below you can see a glimpse into the interactions and 
          special connections I get to form and foster in this role:</p>

        <h3>Service Learning Projects</h3>
        
          <h4>Atomic Orbital Visualizer</h4>
            <p>Used for studying atomic orbitals in Inorganic class</p>

          <h4>Atomic Oribital Visualizer app</h4>
            <p>Study on the go</p>

          <h4>Custom Tutoring Problems</h4>
            <p>I created problems in various subjects for individuals I tutor so they could have material to practice
              with that would cover the concepts they would be exposed to on exams. The inspiration for this came as a
              a result of complaints that practice exams set a false precidence for the real exams in certain classes,
              which would turn out to be different both structurally and sometimes content-wise and would shock the 
              students and result in them performing poorly. To prevent this psychological battle from occuring during
              hours critical to academic success, I fabricated problems, which students knew would not be on the exam,
              that covered all the topics they would be exposed to and provided a comparable, if not greater than, degree
              of difficulty one might find on an exam. This was done in LaTex.
