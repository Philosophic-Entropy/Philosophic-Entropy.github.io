      <h1>Welcome to kamdenperkins.com!</h1>
        <p>This website will serve as a haven for some of my achievements, primarily of the academic and career kind, projects, both personal and professional, and research to be displayed. I decided to create this website after an acquaintance, likely out of jealousy given his lack of much practical engineering experience or engineering research and projects to display, mentioned that continuous LinkedIn users and updaters are of a lesser quality than others, whatever that means.
        </p>
        <p>While I disagree with this, I do agree that it is somewhat less of me to take the easy way out and rely on premade websites; to remedy this I have created a website, as independently as possible (without the use of any AI or website design software), to serve the purposes previously described in addition to creating an opportunity to learn more about something, in this case it is how to create a website.
