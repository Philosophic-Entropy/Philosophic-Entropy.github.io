            <h2>What is the purpose of this website?</h2>
            <p>
                This website will serve as a haven for some of my achievements, primarily of the academic and career
                kind,
                projects, both personal and professional, and research to be displayed.
            </p>

            <h2> Why did I make this website?</h2>
            <p>
                Those that know me, and hopefully to those that do not it is apparent by other means, know that I enjoy
                learning
                and knowledge. To me, there is nothing more important than education; I feel in our current world that
                it is
                easier than ever to learn about anything you want to with a couple clicks. This is in stark contrast
                with a
                version of myself from not too long ago (early 2020s), and he would laugh at that previous statement. He
                also
                went to a high school that, come time for graduation, produced as many parents from my graduating class
                as
                college-bound individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I was fortunate enough to have been given a chance, one that at the time I did not ask for nor
                want, to
                enroll at Louisiana Tech University; it was here that, after some time of immense dissatisfaction with
                and
                disdain of education in general, I began to develop my appreciation for learning and a knowledge of all
                things,
                not just the subjects that my degrees are associated with. Unfortunately, this appreciation was
                developed later
                than I would have liked it to, which is shown in my GPA that is lower than I would like it to be.
                Nonetheless,
                it is on this website I hope to portray this obsession with the advancement of the mind, the process of
                bettering oneself as a goal is continuously being sought to be achieved, the elevation of education for
                all
                those that come after me in an attempt to give back to the fields that have given me so much, and the
                pruning of
                interest for those around me in various subjects. This portrayal will ideally be evident not only in the
                content
                that is shown but on the website itself, as this website is a pet project that I am doing that will
                teach me
                something new solely for the purpose of doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although what finally prompted me to act, which I had been meaning to do for a while, and create this
                website
                was after an acquaintance, likely out of jealousy given his lack of much practical engineering
                experience or
                engineering research and projects to display, mentioned that continuous LinkedIn users and updaters are
                of a
                lesser quality than others, whatever that means.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I disagree with this, I do agree that it is somewhat less of me to take the easy way out and rely
                on
                premade websites; to remedy this, somewhat out of spite, I have created a website, as independently as
                possible
                (without the use of any AI or website design software), to serve the purposes previously described in
                addition
                to creating an opportunity to learn more about something, in this case it is how to create a website.
